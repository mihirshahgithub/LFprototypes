# Prototypes

## PHP - Introduction

To get these files to your local machine you will need to do the following

1. Open your console to the proper directory
2. Type the following command:
	- `git checkout master` - This will switch you to your master branch
3. pull from the original Learningfuze repo
	- Use the following command:
		`git pull https://github.com/Learning-Fuze/prototypes.git master`
	- This will pull all the files from the original LearningFuze repo that you forked from, then merge the files with your existing files on your local machine.
4. Still in your console type the following: 
	- `git checkout -b php-intro` press enter
	- This will create a new branch for this prototype

**NOTE:**
- When you commit and push your files to gitHub you need to push them to your new branch
- To do this do the following:
	- `git add . ` - To add the files
	- `git commit -m "Your message here"` - This commits the files and adds a message
	- `git push origin php-intro` - This will push your files to gitHub on your new branch

### Getting Started

1. Two files have been included in this prototype
    - `from.php`
    - `to.js`

2. You will be entering your code directly into the `to.js` file
    - Enter your translated code into the appropriate section in the `to.js` file

3. **DO NOT** edit this README

## PHP Introduction

### Prototype

1. Look through the `from.php` file
    - Try figuring out what each exercise is doing 
2. Translate the php code into JavaScript 
    - Place your translated code into the `to.js` file
    - Put the translated code into its corresponding section

## After you have completed all the above

1. add, commit, and push your updated files to your php-intro branch on gitHub
	- `git add . ` - To add the files
	- `git commit -m "Your message here"` - This commits the files and adds a message
	- `git push origin php-intro ` - This will push your files to gitHub on your new branch
2. Create a pull request
	- Title your pull request: `Your Name - php-intro`
	- Make sure you are creating the pull request as follows:
	- In the image below make sure the numbered arrows match **YOUR** info
		- 1. Should be your branch name - Look down the list to find your branch
		- 2. Should be your Repo name - Look down the list to find your Repo
		- 3. Should be your php-intro branch
	- If you are unsure on any of this or are unable to find your branch or repo, ask for help, don't just guess
	- This is important if you want feedback and credit for the prototypes
