    <p class="about-me">I enjoy writing, and all things sports.  I am a die hard Lakers fan; I bleed purple and gold.  Education has immeasurable value to me; however, I am convinced that the current educational model is in for a rude awakening.  As a school counselor, one of my goals is to create a program that can improve counselor-student accessibility.  I enjoy hanging out, watching Game of Thrones, the Flash, and Mr. Robot has definitely caught my attention as well.
